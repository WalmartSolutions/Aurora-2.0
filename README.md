# Why?
This cheat is pure TH Recode rename and got gassed in like 5 mins because of it being 1:1 TH Recode. All it took to crack it was to replace the Main Class and ModuleManager onLoad() method. The devs also have a "COD3R" role which is a pure disrespect to all the hard working developers in this community. Enjoy this sh1t

**If client crashes, use -noverify (Client issue)**
